## Open Source Introduction

Open source promotes the openness and accessibility of all useful information for studying, modifying, or replicating a piece of software or hardware. The **reuse** of existing designs is, therefore, a fundamental requirement for open source.

We use a template standing as minimum viable documentation for open source hardware. By cloning this repository from OpenNext, we stand for a standardized open-source hardware documentation.

Product life cycle phases consist:
* Idea generation
* Need analysis 
* Concept development
* Product development and prototyping
* Produce/replication
* Use
* Maintenance
* Dismantle/recycle
